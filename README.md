Solution for the ML Ops Challenges

This repository contains a potential solution for the MLOps challenges located on [Microsoft Learn](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-mlops/). It is possible to achieve the Challenges using different methods, this is a singular potential solution.

The solutions contained within do not contain the challenges themselves, it is expected that you use both the Challenge site and potential solutions together (they don't make sense without each other).

If desired, attempt the challenges on your own and refer to these solutions if you get stuck.

1. [Challenge 0 - Convert a notebook to production code](Challenge0.md)
2. [Challenge 1 - Create an Azure Machine Learning job](Challenge1.md)
3. [Challenge 2 - Trigger the Azure Machine Learning job with GitHub Actions](Challenge2.md)
4. [Challenge 3 - Trigger GitHub Actions with trunk-based development](Challenge3.md)
5. [Challenge 4 - Work with linting and unit testing](Challenge4.md)
6. [Challenge 5 - Work with environments](Challenge5.md)
7. [Challenge 6 - Deploy and test the model](Challenge6.md)

Very helpful MS Learn labs you can try on your own (or use as a reference during these challenges) that relate quite heavily to this content can be found here: [Learning Path: End-to-end machine learning operations with Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/build-first-machine-operations-workflow/).

>**Note:** These learn modules link to the challenges above.
